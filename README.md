# System Hardware Final Report

The project designed shows the functioning behind computer's.

The topics covered will include:

- Introduction to Binary & Logic Gates
  - Commonly Used Parts
  - Logic Functions
- The Timing Signal Generator
- The Bus, Arithmetic Unit and Program Counter
- Data Registers and the Memory Address Register
- Program Memory
- The Control Signal Generator

The outcome of this project will enable one to build a computer with a CPU (central processing unit) that can do simple
instructions such as moving data from one register to another and performing simple arithmetics.
## Introduction to Binary & Logic Gates


### Breadboard
   The breadboard will be used to setup the components and all circuits. It is divides in 8 parallel coloumns and contains 5 columns that
   provides power. In fact, the breadboard is made up of two important supply connections: the `VCC` for the red
   line and the `GND` for the blue line. The holes are all connected row-by-row in lines of 5. The power supply is of `5V`.

### Switches
Switches are used to enalble/disable output to control the circuit.
